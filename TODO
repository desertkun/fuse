TODO

* Better show which machines are usable given ROM availability
* Pentagon port #ff returning floating bus issues - it does it because the
  RusFAQ says so?
* PAL Compsite emulation
* Separate out sound buffer interleaving code to allow for the use of hardware
  etc. sound mixing
* Randomise FRAMES sys var after autoload snapshot loaded in order to try and
  get less deterministic program behaviour after load is complete
* Use sheets rather than modal dialogs (for Save As)
* Allow Cmd-w to close as many windows as possible
* Make border display/size optional
* Make activity icons transparent
* SZX +3 block - seems to be redundant?
* Add QuickLook HTML view showing Title, etc. like QuickLook on MP3s
* Pentagon border emulation?
