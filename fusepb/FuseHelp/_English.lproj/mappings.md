When emulating the Spectrum, the alphanumeric keys (along with Enter and Space) are mapped as-is to the Spectrum keys. The other key mappings are:

KEY | EMULATION
:--- | :---
*Shift* | emulated as Caps Shift
*Command (âŒ˜) and Option* | emulated as Symbol Shift
*Delete* | emulated as Caps-0 (Delete)
*Esc* | emulated as Caps-1 (Edit)
*Caps Lock* | emulated as Caps-2
*Cursor keys* | emulated as Caps-5/6/7/8 (as appropriate)
*Tab* | emulated as emulated as Caps Shift-Symbol Shift (Extended Mode)

Some further punctuation keys are supported, if they exist on your keyboard -
',', '.', '/', ';', ''', '#', '-', '\_', '+', ';', ':', ''', '"', '<', '>' and
'='. These are mapped to the appropriate symbol-shifted keys on the Spectrum.
