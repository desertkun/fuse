Use the Sound pane of Fuse preferences to configure Fuses sound output.

OPTION | DESCRIPTION
:--- | :---
*Enabled* | Specify whether sound output should be enabled at all. When this option is disabled, Fuse will not make any sound.
*Beeper Volume* | Slider for the relative volume of the built-in beeper.
*AY Volume* | Slider for the relative volume of the AY-3-8912 chip in machines/interfaces that have one.
*SpecDrum Volume* | Slider for the relative volume of the SpecDrum when used as a peripheral.
*Speaker Type* | This option allows the emulation of the sound output system to be modified. Different choices of speaker limit the bass and treble response that can be produced from the machine. Choose between a "TV" type speaker and a small beeper type speaker that significantly limits bass and treble response.
*Loading sounds* | Normally, Fuse emulates tape-loading noise when loading from PZXs, TAPs or TZXs in real-time, albeit at a deliberately lower volume than on a real Spectrum. You can disable this option to eliminate the loading noise entirely.
*AY stereo separation* | By default, the sound output is mono, since this is all you got from an unmodified Spectrum. But enabling this option gives you so-called ACB stereo (for sound from the 128's AY-3-8912 sound chip).
