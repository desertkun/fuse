Fuse supports multiface POKEs, allowing to modify specific memory addresses in
order to cheat (infinite lives, infinite ammo, etc.).

The 'POKEs/Cheats' dialog contains a list of recently loaded POKEs from a POK
file. It is accessed from the *Machine > POKEs/Cheats* menu option.

It is possible to load POKEs from an external file using the *File > Open…* menu
option or the drag‐and‐drop functionality. After loading a snapshot or tape,
Fuse will try to automatically locate a POK file with the same file name. This
means that if we open 'GAME.TAP' then Fuse will try to open 'GAME.POK' and
'POKES/GAME.POK' See [the description at the World of Spectrum](http://www.worldofspectrum.org/POKformat.txt) for more details about this file format.

POKEs loaded in the list can be activated or deactivated as the user wants and
will remain in memory until a machine reset.
