title: Setting Fuse Preferences
group: Fuse Preferences

Fuse has many options to control various details of the emulator and the machine
being emulated. You use preferences to specify things such as the model of
Sinclair Spectrum that you want to emulate, or the peripherals you would like to
have connected to the virtual machine. Also note that any changes that enable
and disable peripherals may result in a hard reset of the emulated machine.

To view or change preferences choose *Fuse > Preferences*.
