The DivIDE is another IDE interface for the Spectrum, of which full details can
be found on the
[DivIDE homepage](http://web.archive.org/web/20150302052256/http://baze.au.com/divide/).
The interface can be activated via the *DivIDE interface* option on the
[Peripherals preferences](peripherals.html) dialog, and the state of its write
protect jumper controlled via the *DivIDE write protect* option. If you're going
to be using the DivIDE, you'll probably want one of the firmwares available from
the DivIDE homepage.
