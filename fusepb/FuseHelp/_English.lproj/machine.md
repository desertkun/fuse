Choose a type of Spectrum to emulate. An brief overview of the Sinclair, Amstrad
and Timex computers can be found at [http://www.nvg.ntnu.no/sinclair/computers/zxspectrum/zxspectrum.htm](http://www.nvg.ntnu.no/sinclair/computers/zxspectrum/zxspectrum.htm), while more technical information can be found at [http://www.worldofspectrum.org/faq/reference/reference.htm](http://www.worldofspectrum.org/faq/reference/reference.htm).

MACHINE | DESCRIPTION
:--- | :---
*Spectrum 16K, Spectrum 48K* | The original machines as released by Sinclair in 1982 with 16 or 48K of RAM respectively.
*Spectrum 48K (NTSC)* | The NTSC 48K machine released in limited numbers in parts of South America.
*Spectrum 128K* | The 128K machine as released by Sinclair in 1985 (Spain) or 1986 (UK).
*Spectrum +2* | The first machine released by Amstrad, in 1986. From an emulation point of view, the +2 is virtually identical to the 128K.
*Spectrum +2A, Spectrum +3* | The two machines released by Amstrad in 1988. Technically very similar to each other, except that the +3 features a 3" disk drive while the +2A does not.
*Spectrum +3e* | A +3 with modified ROMs allowing access to IDE hard disks via the simple 8-bit interface, as activated from the Preferences, Peripherals dialog. See http://www.worldofspectrum.org/zxplus3e/ for more details.
*Timex TS2068* | The NTSC variant of the Spectrum as released by Timex in North America.
*Timex TC2048, Timex TC2068* | The variants of the Spectrum as released by Timex in Portugal. See [http://www.worldofspectrum.org/faq/reference/tmxreference.htm](http://www.worldofspectrum.org/faq/reference/tmxreference.htm) for more details on the Timex models.
*Pentagon 128K* | Russian clone of the Spectrum. There were many different machines called Pentagon from 1989 to 2006, this machine corresponds to a 1991 era Pentagon-128K with the optional AY sound chip and the integrated Beta 128 disk interface, and is the version of the machine most often emulated. More technical details can be found at [http://www.worldofspectrum.org/rusfaq/index.html](http://www.worldofspectrum.org/rusfaq/index.html). Note: as there is no explicit permission to distribute the ROM files for the Pentagon machines they must be downloaded separately and configured for use with Fuse in the Preferences, ROM dialog.
*Pentagon 512K, Pentagon 1024K* | Newer versions of the Pentagon Russian Spectrum clones which incorporate more memory and the "Mr Gluk Reset Service" ROM offering a more powerful firmware. Note: as there is no explicit permission to distribute the ROM files for the Pentagon machines they must be downloaded separately and configured for use with Fuse in the Preferences, ROM dialog.
*Scorpion ZS 256* | Another Russian clone of the Spectrum. Some details can be found at [http://www.worldofspectrum.org/rusfaq/index.html](http://www.worldofspectrum.org/rusfaq/index.html). Like all the Russian clones they have built in 3.5" disk drives, accessed via the Betadisk interface and TR-DOS (the Technology Research Disk Operating System). The most important distinction from the Pentagon 128k and similar machines is the display timing details. Note: as there is no explicit permission to distribute the ROM files for the Scorpion machine they must be downloaded separately and configured for use with Fuse in the Preferences, ROM dialog.
*Spectrum SE* | A recent variant designed by Andrew Owen and Jarek Adamski, which is possibly best thought of as a cross between the 128K machine and the Timex variants, allowing 272K of RAM to be accessed. Some more details are available at [http://www.worldofspectrum.org/faq/reference/sereference.htm](http://www.worldofspectrum.org/faq/reference/sereference.htm), and documentation of the extended BASIC is available at [https://github.com/cheveron/sebasic4/wiki](https://github.com/cheveron/sebasic4/wiki). The bug tracker for the BASIC is at [https://github.com/cheveron/sebasic4/issues?state=open](https://github.com/cheveron/sebasic4/issues?state=open).
