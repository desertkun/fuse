title: The Emulated Spectrum
description: This section describes the machine as emulated by Fuse.
order: 60
---

The emulated Spectrum is, by default, an unmodified 48K Spectrum with a tape
player and ZX Printer attached. Oh, and apparently some magical snapshot
load/save machine which is probably best glossed over for the sake of the
analogy. :-)

To emulate different kinds of Spectrum, use the [Machines](machine.html) tab on
the preferences screen (available from the *Fuse > Preferences* menu option).

The Spectrum emulation is paused when any dialogs appear.
