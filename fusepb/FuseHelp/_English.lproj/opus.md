description: This section describes the Opus Discovery interface emulation in Fuse.
order: 130
group: Floppy Disk Interfaces
---

By default, Fuse emulates the Opus Discovery interface with the optional 2k RAM
expansion and a second 40 track single sided disk drive.

See the [Disk File Formats](formats.html) section for more details on supported
disk file formats. The Opus Discoveries' printer port is also emulated for
output only. (See the [Printer Emulation](printer.html) section for more
details). The Opus Discovery may only be used with 16K, 48K, 128K, TC2048 and +2
(not +2A) emulation.

To access disks, use the same syntax as the Interface I and Microdrives.

## ROM File

The ROM file for the Opus Discovery is not freely distributable and so is not
included in this package. In order to use the Opus Discovery emulation you will
need to download a copy of the ROM file and use the *Preferences > ROM* dialog
to configure the file for use with Fuse.
