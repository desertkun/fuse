Fuse is a Sinclair ZX Spectrum emulator. It supports several models (including
the 128, Timex and Russian clone machines), with quite faithful emulation of the
display and sound.

The emulator can load many snapshot formats including Z80, SNA and SZX
snapshots, as well as TAP, TZX and PZX virtual-tape files. Saving to SZX, Z80,
and SNA snapshots and TZX and TAP tape files is supported. The SLT extension to
the Z80 format is partly supported (enough for multi-load games); however,
loading of the old DAT-file variant is not.

DSK, UDI, FDI, TD0, MGT, IMG, D40, D80, SAD, TRD, SCL and OPD disk images are
supported when a disk interface is being emulated, including the integrated disk
drives on +3, Pentagon or Scorpion machines as well as the +D, DISCiPLE, DivIDE,
DivMMC, ZXMMC, Opus Discovery, Beta 128 and Didaktik 80 interfaces. DCK
cartridge images are supported when emulating a Timex 2068 variant. Interface 2
ROM cartridges are also supported.

Finally, there is also support for reading and writing the RZX input recording
format.
