              rollback facilities to be used without having to
              explicitly add snapshots into the stream. Older snapshots
              will be pruned from the stream to keep the file size and
              number of snapshots down: each snapshot up to 15 seconds
              will be kept, then one snapshot every 15 seconds until one
              minute, then one snapshot every minute until 5 minutes,
              and then one snapshot every 5 minutes. Note that this
              "pruning" applies only to automatically inserted
              snapshots: snapshots manually inserted into the stream

              this means that Fuse will act just like a real Spectrum
              would: you can't load snapshots, pause the emulation in
              any way, change the speed or anything that you couldn't do
              on the real machine. If any of these things are attempted,
              or if the emulated Fuse is running more than 5% faster or
              slower than normal Spectrum speed, then the recording will
              immediately be stopped.<br>

              digitally signed, in theory to "certify" that it was made

                procedure is not secure</i><i> (and cannot be made so),
                so the presence of any signature on an RZX</i><i> file
                should not be taken as providing proof that it was made
                with</i><i> competition mode active.</i> This feature is
              included in Fuse solely as it was one of the requirements
              for Fuse to be used in an on-line tournament.</font><font
