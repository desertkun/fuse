<h2><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">About
Fuse</font></h2>
</div>
<p><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Fuse is a Sinclair ZX
Spectrum emulator. It supports several models (including the 128, Timex
and Russian clone machines),
with quite faithful emulation of the display and sound.</font></p>
<p><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">The emulator can load
many snapshot formats including Z80, SNA and SZX snapshots, as well
as TAP, TZX and PZX virtual-tape files. Saving to SZX, Z80, and SNA
snapshots and
TZX and TAP tape files is supported. The SLT extension to the Z80
format is
partly supported (enough for multi-load games); however, loading of
the old DAT-file variant is not.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">
DSK, UDI, FDI, TD0, MGT, IMG, D40, D80, SAD, TRD, SCL and OPD
disk images are supported when a disk interface is being emulated,
including the integrated disk drives on +3, Pentagon or Scorpion
machines as well as the +D, DISCiPLE, Opus Discovery, Beta 128 and
Didaktik 80 interfaces. DCK cartridge images are supported when
emulating a Timex 2068 variant. Interface 2 ROM cartridges are
also supported.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Finally, there is also
support
for reading and writing the RZX input recording
format.</font></p>
