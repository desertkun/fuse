      <font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Fuse can save movies
        with sound in a specific file format (FMF). This recording is
        very fast and has a moderate size, but you need to use the
        fmfconv program in fuse&#8208;utils to convert the format into regular
        video and/or audio file. The Movie Compression Level preference
        allows you to set the compression level to None, Lossless or
        High. The default is Lossless.&nbsp; Recording a movie may slow
        down emulation, if you experience performance problems, you can
        try to set compression to None.<br>
        <br>
        Fuse records every displayed frame, so by default the recorded
        file has about 50 video frames per second. A standard&nbsp;
        video has about&nbsp; 24&#8208;30 frames per second framerate,&nbsp;
        so if you set the Frame rate 1:n preference to 2 than recording
        frame rate is reduced to about 25/s. The exact frame rate
        depends on the Z80 clock frequency which varies depending on the
        specific emulated machine.<br>
        Note: You can see all of the Spectrum graphics effects (for
        example those in scene demos) only if the Fuse frame rate option
        is set to 1, but in most cases like game software you can safely
        use a setting of 2. Also, movie recording stops if the emulated
        machine is changed while recording is in progress.<br>
        <br>
        The recorded number of channels matches the sound preferences
        which is set to mono by default. You can record stereo sound if
        you use the AY stereo separation preference.<br>
        <br>
        You can use the fmfconv program from the fuse-utils package to
        convert a FMF-format recorded movie file into a standard video
        file.</font></p>
