      <font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">The ZXATASP and ZXCF
        interfaces are two peripherals designed by
        Sami Vehmaa which significantly extend the capabilities of the
        Spectrum. More details on both are available from Sami's
        homepage,
        <a href="http://user.tninet.se/%7Evjz762w/">http://user.tninet.se/~vjz762w/</a>,
        but
        a
        brief overview is given
        here.</font></p>
    <p>
      <font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">The real ZXATASP comes
        with
        either 128K or 512K of RAM and the
        ability to connect an IDE hard disks and a CompactFlash card,
        while
        the ZXCF comes with 128K, 512K or 1024K of RAM and the ability
        to
        connect a CompactFlash card. From an emulation point of view,
        the
        two interfaces are actually very similar as a CompactFlash card
        is
        logically just an IDE hard disk. Currently, Fuse's emulation is
        fixed at having 512K of RAM in the ZXATASP and 1024K in the
        ZXCF.</font></p>
    <p>
      <font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">To activate the
        ZXATASP,
        simply select the ZXATASP interface option
        from the <a href="peripherals.html"><span style="font-style:
            italic;"></span><span class="emphasis"><em>Peripherals
              preferences</em></span></a> dialog. The state of the
        upload and
        write protect jumpers is then controlled by the ZXATASP upload
        and
        ZXATASP write protect options. Similarly, the ZXCF is controlled
        by
        the ZXCF interface and ZXCF upload options (the ZXCF write
        protect
        is software
        controlled).</font></p>
    <p>
      <font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">If you're using either
        the
        ZXATASP or ZXCF, you almost certainly
        want to investigate ResiDOS, the operating system designed for
        use
        with the ZXATASP and ZXCF. ResiDOS provides facilities for using
        the extra RAM, accessing the mass storage devices and a task
        manager allowing virtually instant switching between programs on
        the Spectrum. See <a
          href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/residos/">http://www.worldofspectrum.org/residos/</a>
        for more
        details.</font></p>
