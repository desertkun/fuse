    <p> <font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Fuse supports
        emulating the DISCiPLE disk and printer interface, although it
        does not currently support emulation of the Sinclair Network, or
        support emulation of a DISCiPLE attached to a 128K machine. See

        are the same as for +D emulation.</font><font face="Lucida

        Grande,Helvetica,Arial"><font face="Lucida
          Grande,Helvetica,Arial">DISCiPLE</font>'s printer port is
        emulated. (See the </font><font face="Lucida

        face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial"> section for more details.)
        The </font><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial"><font
          face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">DISCiPLE</font> may only
        be used with 48K emulation at present.&nbsp; To access disks,
        you will first need to load GDOS, by inserting a disk containing
        the DOS file (SYS) and entering "RUN". Once DOS is loaded, you
        can load to/from DISCiPLE disks by prefixing filenames with <span
          style="font-style: italic;">`d n</span>' where <span
          style="font-style: italic;">` n '</span> is the number of the
        drive in use.&nbsp; For example, `LOAD d1;"myfile"' would load
        the file named `myfile' from the emulated drive 1. Microdrive
        syntax may also be used.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">Snapshots can be saved
        in a similar manner to that of the +D as described above, but
        note that GDOS on the DISCiPLE contains a bug which causes
        corruption as soon as the NMI button is pressed, affecting
        saving of snapshots, and also loading of snapshots that were
        originally saved with a +D or SAM Coup&eacute;. This will cause
        corruption even when a screenshot is printed, or if the menu is
        never even entered in the first place (due to Caps Shift not
        being pressed down, as is required for the DISCiPLE), provided
        that GDOS is loaded. This bug is not present in G+DOS on the +D.
        (Note: this was caused by saving/restoring the AF register twice
        in the NMI handler, where both AF and the AF' shadow register
        should have been saved/restored.)</font></p>
    <font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">
      <p> <font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial"> The NMI button
          works slightly differently on the DISCiPLE than on the +D.
          Caps Shift must be held down whilst pressing the NMI button,
          and there is no &#8216;X&#8217; option to exit the menu. Also, printing of
          screenshots requires GDOS to be loaded.<br>
