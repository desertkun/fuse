      <font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">The `poke finder' is a
        tool
        which is designed to make the task of
        finding (infinite lives etc) pokes for games a bit easier: it is
        similar to the `Lifeguard' utility which was available for use
        with
        the Multiface. It works by maintaining a list of locations in
        which
        the current number of lives (etc) may be stored, and having the
        ability to remove from that list any locations which don't
        contain
        a specified
        value.</font></p>
    <p>
      <font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">The poke finder dialog
        contains an entry box for specifying the
        value to be searched for, a count of the current number of
        possible
        locations and, if there are less than 20 possible locations, a
        list
        of the possible locations (in `page:offset' format). The five
        buttons act as
        follows:</font></p>

      <font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial">An example of how to
        use
        this may make things a bit clearer. We'll
        use the 128K version of Gryzor. Load the game, define keys to
        suit
        and start playing. Immediately pause the game and bring up the
        poke
        finder dialog. We note that we currently have 6 lives, so enter
        `6'
        into the `Search for' field and click `Search'. This reduces the
        number of possible locations to around 931 (you may get a
        slightly
        different number depending on exactly when you paused the game).
        Play along a bit and then (deliberately) lose a life. Pause the
        game again. As we now have 5 lives, replace the `6' in the
        'Search
        for' field with a `5' and click `Search' again. This then
        reduces
        the list of possible locations to just one: page 2, offset
        0x00BC.
        This is the only location in memory which stored `6' when we had
        6
        lives and `5' when we had 5 lives, so its pretty likely that
        this
        is where the lives count is stored. Double-clicking on the
        `2:0x00BC' entry in the dialog will set the appropriate
        breakpoint
        (you may wish to open the debugger at this point to confirm
        this).
        Play along a bit more. When you next lose a life, emulation is
        stopped with PC at 0x91CD. Scrolling up a few addresses in the
        debugger's disassembly pane shows a value was loaded from 0x80BC
        (our hypothetical lives counter), decremented and then stored
        again
        to 0x80BC, which looks very much like the code to reduce the
        number
        of lives. We can now use the debugger to replace the decrement
        with
        a NOP (`set 0x91C9 0'), and playing the game some more after
        this
        reveals that this has worked and we now have infinite
        lives.</font></p>
